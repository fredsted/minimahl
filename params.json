{"name":"minimahl","tagline":"Minimahl - WordPress by Simon Fredsted","body":"### Website for the minimahl Wordpress theme by Simon Fredsted\r\n\r\nMinimahl is a very minimalist and simple blog layout. It's designed to show simple blog posts with simple pages. Not extremely long, complex content.\r\n\r\nScreenshot: \r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/vDGuOCq.png)\r\n\r\nI felt overwhelmed by other wordpress themes. With all their custom control panels and fancy designs, it only serves to slow the site down, make the site uglier by allowing user interference but also introducing vulnerabilities and slowness into the code.\r\n\r\nTherefore I created \"minimahl\", a very small Wordpress theme that does 2 things: let's you write short, great blog articles together with a few pages.\r\n\r\nUsed on my personal website in 2013+2014.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreated in 2013.
